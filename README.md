# Lost and Found System - Setup and Usage Guide
Overview

This project provides a system for managing lost and found items using machine learning for image and text matching. It includes functionality to create a virtual environment, install required dependencies, and run the Python script that performs the desired actions.
Prerequisites

Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Windows OS: The batch script provided is designed for use on Windows.

To install the project, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, prepare your environment by running the startup.bat script located in the root directory of the project. Simply double-click or run the batch script from your terminal. The script will automatically create a virtual environment, activate it, and prompt you to install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
